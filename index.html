        <p>A <strong><span id="abc">Career</strong></span> is an individual's journey through learning, work and other
            aspects of life.Career is a very important aspect of anyone's life. Choosing a career in a certain stream
            defines the future of a student. However, it is difficult for a student to choose a career path at the
            early age. </p>
        <p><span id="bold">Wondering Why to do counseling?</span><br>
            <p>The world of work is changing all the time and fast. Jobs have emerged that didn't exist five or ten
                years ago. And the idea that you'd stick with one career for your entire working life has been left in
                the dust.</p>
            <p>Choosing a career in a particular stream or profession right at the beginning has a long lasting impact
                on a student's future. It is very important for any student to choose carefully from various options
                available to him or her vis a vis his or her interest. In order to achieve success, one has to select
                the path which they like to walk on. Good judgment and right kind of aptitude coupled with guidance in
                the right direction to pick up a definite stream helps one in choosing the right career option. So from
                the very beginning a student should be careful in making choice of their stream.</p>

                <li>Helps in determining a student's true potential</li>
                <li>Despite having a clear idea of what they want to achieve in life, some students do not know the
                    career path they need to follow to have the requisite academic qualification to join a particular
                    course.</li>
                <li>A career counselor also provides essential support and boosts the morale of a student by
                    understanding the kind of requirements.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Once people know where they are headed, they mostly become motivated to work hard to realise their
                goals.</p>
